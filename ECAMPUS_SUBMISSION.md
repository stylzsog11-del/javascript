# 🎯 **FINAL eCampus Submission Links**

## 📋 **Copy These Links Exactly for Your eCampus Assignment:**

### 🔗 **1. GitHub Repository Link:**
```
https://github.com/stylzsog11-del/javascript
```

### 🌐 **2. GitHub Pages Links (Multiple Options - Use Any That Works):**

#### **Option A - Root Directory (Most Reliable):**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/jquery-effects.html
```

#### **Option B - Portfolio Homepage:**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/
```

#### **Option C - Subdirectory Path:**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/jquery-effects/jquery-effects.html
```

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Copied all jQuery files to root directory** - No more path issues
2. **Created multiple access points** - If one doesn't work, others will
3. **Updated portfolio page** - Professional presentation with working links
4. **All dependencies included** - CSS, JS, and image files in correct locations

---

## 🕐 **Important Timing Note:**
- GitHub Pages may take **2-5 minutes** to update after pushing changes
- If links don't work immediately, wait a few minutes and try again
- All three options should work, but Option A is most reliable
