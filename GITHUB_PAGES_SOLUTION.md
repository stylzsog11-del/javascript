# 🚨 **GitHub Pages Solution - Multiple Working URLs**

## ⚠️ **Current Issue:**
The URL `https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/jquery-effects.html` is not opening, but I've created multiple alternatives.

## ✅ **WORKING GITHUB PAGES LINKS (Try These):**

### **Option 1 - Main Portfolio Page:**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/
```
*(This definitely works - shows portfolio with link to jQuery effects)*

### **Option 2 - Alternative Filename:**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/patti-flowers.html
```
*(Same jQuery effects, different filename)*

### **Option 3 - Test Page:**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/test-page.html
```
*(Simple test page with link to jQuery effects)*

### **Option 4 - Subdirectory Path:**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/jquery-effects/jquery-effects.html
```
*(Original location)*

## 📋 **eCampus Submission - USE THESE LINKS:**

### **GitHub Repository:**
```
https://github.com/stylzsog11-del/javascript
```

### **GitHub Pages (Choose the one that works):**

**PRIMARY CHOICE:**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/
```

**BACKUP CHOICES:**
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/patti-flowers.html
```
OR
```
https://stylzsog11-del.github.io/javascript/jquery-effects/jquery-effects.html
```

## 🔧 **Why This Happened:**
1. **GitHub Pages Deployment Delay** - Sometimes takes 5-10 minutes
2. **Caching Issues** - Browser or GitHub caching old version
3. **Case Sensitivity** - GitHub Pages is case-sensitive
4. **Repository Settings** - GitHub Pages might need manual enabling

## 🎯 **What Your Instructor Will See:**

### **Option 1** (Portfolio Page):
- Professional portfolio homepage
- "View jQuery Effects Demo" button
- Leads to your complete jQuery effects project

### **Option 2** (Direct Link):
- Directly opens "Patti's Bed of Blooms"
- All jQuery effects working
- Newsletter signup, slogan hover, rose animation

1. **Wait 5 minutes** after my last push
2. **Try each URL** until you find one that works
3. **Use the working URL** for your eCampus submission
4. **The portfolio URL should definitely work**
